        <h2>PREPARATION: Plan Before You Build</h2>
        <p>Often times people are worried about their future, whether in terms of a career, owning a home, starting a family, etc. People like to set goals and make plans, yet rarely take the time to actually plan things out diligently. Im here to tell you today that God has given us a roadmap to follow, allowing us to plan and avoid such fears.</p>
        <h3>Proverbs 24:27</h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p>"Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The lesson here is the importance of proper priorities. In the ancient world, most people were farmers. Careful planning, in the present, was essential to ensureing there would be food and resources available in the future. Spending time and effort on lesser concerns, when survival was not yet covered, would have been foolish. In a literal example, it would be unwise to construct a permanent home when one doesn't have crops planted yet. After the fields are growing is the proper time to put effort into less crucial areas.</p>
        <p>Crops require specific temperatures, soil moisture, amounts of sun, amounts of water, so picking the correct place to grow crops needs to be planned. Building a house costs money, in this case, money made from selling crops. It would be foolish to build a house without having crops already being grown, as they are the source of your financial gain. Want a family? Then you should have a home already built, a family requires money for food, materials, everything one needs for survival. Starting a family while not having a home already built would mean less money for the production of the home, less for taking care of the family, and less for future crop growth. So it is wise to plan diligently, working accordingly, making sure to accomplish tasks by the level of importance rather than having no structured path to follow.</p>

    <section class="Purpose">
    <h2>PURPOSE: Align With Divine Direction</h2>
    <p>It's not uncommon for people to feel lost in life. Some chase after money, others go after status or attention, hoping it will bring them happiness. But what happens when they get it and still feel empty? The truth is, purpose is not something you find by accident. It is something you must pursue with intention, and God has given us direction to do exactly that.</p>
    <h3>Proverbs 16:9</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"A man's heart deviseth his way: but the Lord directeth his steps."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>It is natural to make plans and want control over life, but ultimately, true direction comes from God. That means we are called to submit our plans, ideas, and goals to Him, allowing Him to adjust our course when necessary. In doing so, we begin to walk in true purpose, not chasing after meaningless pursuits but walking the path God prepared for us in advance.</p>
    <h3>Romans 12:1-2</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice... be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind..."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To find our purpose, we must first reject the patterns of this world. Things like selfish ambition, constant comparison, or temporary gratification. Instead, we are told to renew our minds. That means daily reminding ourselves of who God is, what He has said, and what He requires of us. Living with purpose means living differently. It means choosing discipline over distraction, submission over stubbornness, and faith over fear. When we do this, we begin to understand God’s will and that’s when our steps gain meaning.</p>

<section class="Power">
    <h2>POWER: Walk in What's Already in You</h2>
    <p>Many people feel unequipped to face life. They feel too weak, too broken, too afraid to make the changes they need. But scripture tells us that if we are in Christ, we’ve already been given power, love, and a sound mind. The problem isn’t that we’re missing something, it’s that we haven’t activated what’s already been placed within us.</p>
    <h3>2 Timothy 1:7</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Fear is a liar. It convinces people to stay small, stay silent, and stay stuck. But the Word is clear: fear is not from God. What He has given us is strength. The ability to endure, grow, and push forward. Love. not just for others, but for ourselves, knowing our value and purpose. And a sound mind. The kind of mental clarity and peace that allows us to think, work, and live intentionally.</p>
    <h3>2 Timothy 2:15</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed..."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Power doesn’t come from laziness. It comes from practice. Discipline. Study. Prayer. All of these things sharpen us, just like training strengthens a warrior. We’re called to show ourselves approved. Not by people, but by God. That means doing the work even when no one is watching, even when results are slow. If we remain consistent, we will walk with power. Not because of who we are, but because of who lives within us and what He’s called us to do.</p>
